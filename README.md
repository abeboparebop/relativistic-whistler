relativistic-whistler
=====================

Relativistic whistler dispersion calculator. (Assumes parallel propagation, right circularly polarized waves, nondynamical protons.) The distribution function used is the same as in Gladd 1983.

The primary executable performs a sweep in beta_perp, at each point finding the value of eta = Tperp/Tpar (electrons) that gives the "target" growth rate.
